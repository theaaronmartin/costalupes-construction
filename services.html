          <p class="text-center">
            At Jim Costalupes General Contractor company, we perform our own excavation work and due to our experience and equipment inventory we subcontract to other contractors in the area. Excavation and demolition in the Lake Tahoe region poses many unforeseen challenges.</p>

          <p class="text-center">
            The window of opportunity to excavate in the Lake Tahoe Basin is very short, due to regulations imposed by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), to mitigate site disturbance preventing erosion during winter months. Due to this short period (May 1st through October 15th), it is important to have the proper equipment and crew in place to schedule and excavate as soon as permits are approved. Due to the environmental sensitivity and the possibility of unearthing large boulders, special equipment is a must to meet these challenges in a timely manner.

            One advantage to owning such a large inventory of earth moving vehicles, is to perform Snow Removal maintenance on contractual or "On-call" basis.

Our rates are very competitive, and we respond during all hours based on storm conditions, and contractual agreements. Give us a call to bid on your Snow Removal needs.
